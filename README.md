## Vance's portfolio site!

---

This is a cool new site i'm creating using Next.js and Material UI.

Current Roadmap
- Create home page to display some information about myself and skills \(in progress\)
- Create blog dynamically rendering MDX content
- Create projects page as a fun sandbox to practice and show off new things
- Create private login page for users

```To work, I go!```<br><br>
